# EEC270_final-proj

For the course project in EEC270 Computer Architectures, we fingerprinted the website users are opening based on hardware events using Perf and deep learning. First, we profiled the top 30 websites with Perf and collect 4 Hardware Performance Events (HPE). Then, we tried to identify the most effective Machine Learning (ML) techniques for identifying the website users are opening. The code here is about the two of the ML techniques we have used; Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

The "training.csv" file is the training data set we used.
